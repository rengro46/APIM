## Project Overview

In order to streamline integrations across tier-2 systems and establish a standard API-based communication framework, this project will design and implement an API integration layer using Microsoft Azure API Management (APIM). This layer will serve as the standard integration method for all future development projects, enabling consistent, scalable, and secure API interactions across the enterprise.

---

### Objectives

* Establish a centralized API gateway using Microsoft Azure APIM.
* Standardize API integration practices across all development teams.
* Improve security, governance, and monitoring of API communications.
* Enable seamless interoperability between tier-2 enterprise systems.
* Reduce development time and effort by providing reusable API endpoints.
* Ensure compliance with industry security and data protection standards.

---

### Scope

#### In Scope:

* Design and deployment of Microsoft Azure APIM as the enterprise API gateway.
* Integration of key tier-2 systems, including but not limited to:
  * ServiceNow
  * SCCM
  * Active Directory (AD)
  * MDM & Intune
  * SolarWinds
  * Warranty data sources (HP, Dell, Lenovo)
* Development of standardized API specifications and documentation.
* Implementation of security policies, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.
* API versioning and lifecycle management framework.
* Performance monitoring, logging, and analytics setup.
* Training and enablement for development teams on API usage and best practices.

#### Out of Scope:

* Replacing existing integrations that are not part of tier-2 systems.
* Direct integration with tier-1 or third-party external systems unless explicitly required.
* On-premise integration services outside of Azure APIM.

### Stakeholders

* Project Sponsor: CTO
* Project Owner: Information Security Manager
* Development Teams
* Enterprise Architecture Team
* Security & Compliance Team
* IT Operations & Support Team
* Business Units Utilizing API Services

---

### Deliverables

* Functional API Gateway deployed in Microsoft Azure APIM.
* Documented API standards, policies, and best practices.
* Security and access management framework.
* API catalog and developer portal for self-service integration.
* Monitoring and analytics dashboard.
* User training and knowledge transfer sessions.

---

### Assumptions

* All integrated tier-2 systems have API capabilities or can be adapted.
* Adequate cloud infrastructure and budget are available for Azure APIM implementation.
* Development teams are willing to adopt the standardized API approach.
* Necessary security policies and compliance standards can be met.

### Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy|
|------|--------------------|
| Resitance to adoption from Dev teams |  Conduct training and awareness sessions, provide strong documentation and support. |
| Security vulnerabilty in API integrations | Implement strict authentication, authorisation and encryption measures. |
| Performance issues due to high API load | Optimise API gateway configuration, implement caching and rate limiting. |
| Integration challenges with legacy systems | Conduct early technical assessments and establish middleware where necessary. |
| Scope creep due to evolving requirements | Maintain strict change control and stakeholder alignment. |

---

### Timeline & Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date |
| Project Kickoff | Start |
